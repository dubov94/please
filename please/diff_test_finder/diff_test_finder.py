    Takes diff of problem's directory before and after generator executing,
    may take mask of tests and may take mask of files, that exactly are not tests
    Requires path to directory in which generator executed.
    May take a name of file of redirected stdout of generator, if there is no test
    generated in filesystem.
    Masks are in python.re syntax.
    Returns list of test relative paths from execute_dir.
    
    Example:

    (mask in cmd or bash corresponds with *.in, exclude corresponds with ../trash*.in)
    tests = test_finder.tests(diff, 'generator_stdout.out')
